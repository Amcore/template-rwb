# react-webpack-boilerplate

> A SPA boilerplate with React, built with love.
> This Branch is for webpack 2.2

## Goals
 - **React**
 - **JSX**
 - **ES6**
 - **Webpack**
 - **Express** the dev-server.
 - **Hot-Reload**
 - **Proxy** I think most of the boilerplates drop this important feature.
 - **Global-Variable**
 - **ESlint**

## Usage

In the very beginning you need to `clone` this project in your local environment.
```bash
# install all this dependencies.
npm install

# development, default port: 3000
npm run dev

# production
npm run build
```
